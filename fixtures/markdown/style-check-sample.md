# Style Check Fixture

This paragraph is basically a test fixture.
We acted in order to finish quickly due to the fact that time was short.
When discussions dragged, we started to beat around the bush.

## Expected style flags

- `basically` (filler)
- `in order to` (redundancy)
- `due to the fact that` (redundancy)
- `beat around the bush` (cliche)
