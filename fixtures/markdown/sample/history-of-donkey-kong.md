# History of Donkey Kong

Donkey Kong is a video game franchise owned by Nintendo, starring the eponymous gregarious ape character. The original **Donkey Kong** arcade game, released in 1981, is one of the most important titles in gaming history. It introduced players to our barrel-throwing gorilla, a heroic carpenter (later revealed to be Mario), and a damsel in distress named Pauline, establishing many conventions that would define the platformer genre.

## The Arcade Era (1981–1984)

The original *Donkey Kong* game was created by **Shigeru Miyamoto** and released by Nintendo in July 1981. Miyamoto designed the game after Nintendo failed to secure the license for *Popeye* and needed a new arcade title. He repurposed the concept of a villain, a hero, and a love interest with original characters: the ape Donkey Kong, the carpenter Jumpman (renamed Mario), and Pauline.

The game was an immediate commercial and critical success. Nintendo sold more than 60,000 arcade cabinets in North America alone, earning over $180 million in quarters during its first year. The game's four-stage structure, with an iconic "How high can you get?" climax, became a template repeated across countless games.

Two sequels followed in the arcades: *Donkey Kong Jr.* (1982), in which players controlled the ape's son trying to rescue his captured father from Mario, and *Donkey Kong 3* (1983), a fixed shooter that stepped away from platforming.

## Home Ports and Legal Controversy

In 1981, Coleco secured the rights to port Donkey Kong to home consoles, including ColecoVision, Atari 2600, and the ColecoVision Adam. The Atari 2600 port was notoriously poor, missing the pie factory stage and suffering from degraded graphics, a source of significant consumer backlash. The NES port (1986) was considered faithful and helped establish the console's library.

The game's success also spawned a notable legal dispute. **Universal City Studios** sued Nintendo in 1984, claiming Donkey Kong infringed on the *King Kong* intellectual property. Nintendo, represented by attorney John Kirby (whose name reportedly inspired the character Kirby), won decisively. The court found that Universal itself had successfully argued in a prior case that *King Kong* was in the public domain, undermining their own lawsuit.

## The SNES Era and Donkey Kong Country (1994)

The franchise lay relatively dormant through the late 1980s and early 1990s until **Rare**, a British developer, partnered with Nintendo to create *Donkey Kong Country* for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in November 1994, the game was a revelation with pre-rendered 3D graphics that looked unlike anything else on the hardware at the time.

*Donkey Kong Country* sold over 9 million copies, becoming one of the best-selling SNES games ever made. It also rebooted the franchise's cast, replacing the original villain-ape Donkey Kong with a heroic, tie-wearing descendant. The villain of the original arcade game was retroactively renamed **Cranky Kong** and recast as the new DK's grandfather.

Rare followed with two sequels: *Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest* (1995) and *Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!* (1996), both of which were commercially successful and critically praised.

## Nintendo 64 and Rareware's Run (1994–2007)

Rare continued the franchise on the Nintendo 64 with *Donkey Kong 64* (1999), a 3D collect-a-thon platformer that featured five playable Kong characters. While commercially successful, it drew some criticism for its exhaustive collectible requirements. The game is also remembered for introducing the now infamous and oft-memed *DK Rap*.

After Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002, Nintendo regained sole control of the Donkey Kong IP. Rare's run on the franchise effectively ended.

## The Retro Studios Revival (2010–Present)

In 2010, **Retro Studios**, the Austin, Texas developer behind the acclaimed *Metroid Prime* series, released *Donkey Kong Country Returns* for the Wii. The game was widely praised for reviving the classic side-scrolling format with modern polish, tight controls, and challenging level design.

Retro followed with *Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze* in 2014 for Wii U, and later for Nintendo Switch in 2018. *Tropical Freeze* is frequently cited by critics and players as one of the finest 2D platformers ever made, particularly for its dynamic soundtrack composed by **David Wise**, who had scored the original Country trilogy.

## Switch Era (2018–Present)

The Nintendo Switch brought renewed attention to the franchise. *Tropical Freeze* was ported to the platform in 2018 to strong sales, introducing the game to a new generation of players and reinforcing its reputation as a modern classic.

The most significant entry of the era is **Donkey Kong Bananza**, announced in January 2025 as a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title. Developed by Nintendo EPD, the internal studio behind *Super Mario Odyssey*, *Bananza* marks the first fully 3D Donkey Kong game since *Donkey Kong 64* in 1999, a gap of over 25 years. The game features large, destructible environments that DK can punch, smash, and tunnel through using his signature brute strength. Players can demolish nearly any surface in the world, creating new paths and uncovering secrets hidden beneath layers of terrain.

*Bananza* also introduces a younger **Pauline**, the character from the original 1981 arcade game, as a major playable partner, bringing the franchise back to its roots while pushing the gameplay in an entirely new direction.

## Legacy

Donkey Kong's legacy spans more than four decades. The original arcade game is preserved in the Smithsonian Institution and the Strong National Museum of Play. The character has appeared in dozens of spin-offs, crossovers, and *Super Smash Bros.* titles. In 2024, Universal Studios opened **Donkey Kong Country**, a themed land at Universal Studios Japan and later at Universal Epic Universe in Orlando.
