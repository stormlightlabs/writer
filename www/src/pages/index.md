## Local-First

Most writing apps want your content living on their servers, wrapped in proprietary formats. Writer doesn't. Your documents are plain markdown files sitting in whatever folder structure you already use. Bring your own sync, your own backups, your own workflow. Writer just gets out of the way and lets you write.

## Distraction-free Writing

The interface is minimal on purpose. Focus mode centers your cursor and fades everything else out so you can stay in flow.
When you need to check formatting, split the editor and preview side by side. When you don't, go full-screen and forget the UI is there.

## Make it yours

Writer ships with a built-in style checker that flags filler words, redundancies, and clichés as you type, and you can add your own patterns too. Set up a global hotkey for quick capture so ideas don't slip away. Tweak the layout to match how you think.

## Open Source

Writer is open source and built with modern tools: Tauri 2, React 19, CodeMirror 6, and Rust. Contribute, fork, or just peek under the hood.
