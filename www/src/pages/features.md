# Features

## Markdown Editor

The editor is built on CodeMirror 6 - fast, accessible, and keyboard-friendly.

- **Live Preview** - See your rendered output alongside raw markdown
- **Split Panes** - Editor-only, preview-only, or side-by-side layouts
- **Resizable Divider** - Drag to adjust how much space each pane gets
- **Document Tabs** - Keep multiple files open and drag to reorder them

## Focus Mode

When you need to concentrate, focus mode strips the interface down to what matters.

- **Typewriter Scrolling** - Your cursor stays centered on screen as you type
- **Dimming** - Surrounding text fades so you're only looking at the current context
- **Minimal Chrome** - Toolbars and panels step aside

## Writing Assistance

Writer gives you real-time feedback without being overbearing about it.

- **Style Check** - Flags filler words, redundancies, and clichés as you type
- **Parts-of-Speech Highlighting** - Visualize the structure of your sentences
- **Custom Patterns** - Add your own rules to match your style guide

## Workspace Management

Point Writer at your folders and it handles the rest.

- **Multiple Locations** - Add any folder on your system as a workspace
- **File Operations** - Create, rename, move, and delete files and folders from the sidebar
- **Filesystem Watching** - Changes made outside Writer are picked up automatically
- **Conflict Detection** - If a file is modified externally while you have it open, Writer lets you know

## Quick Capture

Ideas show up at inconvenient times. Quick capture lets you grab them without breaking stride.

- **Global Hotkey** - Open the capture window from anywhere on your system
- **Quick Note** - Creates a timestamped markdown file in your inbox folder
- **Append Mode** - Add text to an existing document
- **Writing Session** - Create a note and jump straight into the editor

Turn your markdown into a formatted PDF when you need to share or print.

- **Page Layout** - Configure page size, orientation, and margins
- **Custom Fonts** - Pick the typography that fits the document
- **Headers & Footers** - Add page numbers, titles, or dates

## Session Persistence

Close Writer, come back later, and everything is where you left it.

- **Tab State** - Your open documents are remembered between sessions
- **Layout Settings** - Pane sizes and positions are preserved
- **Conflict Detection** - If a file changed while you were away, you'll know about it
